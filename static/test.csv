"Deelee Dubé","2019-10-18","20:00:00","THE BASEMENT BAR","","Deelee Dubé","","DEELEE DUBÉ ""A beguiling soulfulness""  Jazz Times
Winner of the 2016 Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition, Deelee Dubé (pronounced Doo-bay, accented ""é"") is a one of the most gifted vocalists to have emerged from the London scene in many years. Embodying a stellar African musical lineage, the eclectic tastes of a London upbringing and a deep love and respect for the jazz tradition, Deelee possesses what Jazz Times called 'a warm tone, genuine blues feeling and easy rhythmic authority.'
Deelee's late father was the famed South African jazz pianist Jabu Nkosi; her grandfather another legendary figure from the country's music scene, saxophonist and bandleader Zacks (Isaac) Nkosi. Deelee was brought up with music all around her, and formed her first band at the age of 14. She attended the BRIT School for arts and music, and received formal voice sessions under Anton Browne later studying under vocalist Clare Foster, and forming the first of many musical relationships with jazz pianist Roland Perrin. She has most recently been under the private tutelage of Jazz artist and teacher Rachel Gould and Renato D'Aiello who also acts as her mentor.
A songwriter as well as a singer, Deelee has had her work reach the semi-finals of the UK Song writing (UKSC) Contest. She also teaches as a freelance voice coach and singing teacher, conducting one-to-one sessions under her business 'Vocal InsightTM', based around the Estill Voice Training System. Her sessions combine her own experiential knowledge with music theory. Deelee is also a poet, and her work has been published in Write & Shine (Poetry Now Young Writers Book, 1995) and the Book of Dreams (United Press, 2010).
A regular performer at the legendary London venue Ronnie Scott's with saxophonist Renato D'Aiello, Deelee has played at the Hackney Empire, The Queen Elizabeth Hall, The Troubadour, Pizza Express (Dean St.) Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, 12 Bar, Bush Hall, Caffe Chioggia (Venice, Italy), the Royal Albert Hall, 606 Club, The Troubadour, and many other venues large and small. She has appeared in music videos for Florence & The Machine and BarclayCard, and in April 1998 performed in the chorus of Mark-Anthony Turnage's Greek at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.

"Heard Collective + Charlotte Campbell","2019-10-18","20:30:00","GREEN NOTE","","Heard Collective","Charlotte Campbell","HEARD COLLECTIVE

An all-female collective promoting and supporting women in music return to the Green Note after their sell-out show last spring.

More about the artists...
CHARLOTTE CAMPBELL has made a name for herself as a London street musician, charming the ears of locals and tourists alike. Through glorious summers and bitterly cold winters, she can be found sharing her original music with crowds along the Southbank.
While she still enjoys busking, Charlotte has built a worldwide fanbase through her regular street gigs and subsequently tours regularly in venues in the UK, Germany and Switzerland. As well as taking the stage at various music festivals including Glastonbury. Having released 3 albums worth of original songs, her music is being heard all over; her most recent single ""Nothing"" has been playlisted in Caffe Nero stores across the country.
SIMEON HAMMOND DALLAS is a singer-songwriter from London's Camden Town. An overactive mind and a desire to live a life like a travel montage from a rom-com provide the inspiration for her music; a folky bluesy country-soul amalgamation. An enemy of dichotomy, her music is soft and vulnerable while packing a punch at the same time.""
 
DAISY CHUTE is a folk songstress and multi-instrumentalist and regular on the London music scene. Represented by Talentbanq and an award-winning artist, Daisy came first in the Coffee Music Project singer-songwriter competition with her song 'London's on Fire' and her 3 most recent singles are being played in over 600 stores worldwide in Caffe Nero. Daisy has been busy performing both in the UK and abroad with tours to America and festival appearances including Glastonbury and Cornbury. One of Paul Sexton's 'top music tips', Daisy's music has been compared to Simon and Garfunkel and Joni Mitchell (BBC Radio Kent).
""Beautiful, exquisite melodies, insightful lyrics and a wealth of wonderful musicality makes Daisy an artist that is destined for great things.."" (Soho Radio)

 
CERIAN - Described as ""the purest voice on radio"" (BBC) and selected as one of Music Republic Magazine's ""ones to watch"" in 2019, London singer-songwriter, Cerian, is a multi-instrumentalist described as a cross between Kate Bush, Joni Mitchell and London Grammar, weaving together soaring melodic vocals and rich harmony with poetic lyrics. Having sung with the likes of U2, Radiohead, Thom Yorke, Sam Smith, Imogen Heap and Charlotte Church, she is now taking on the world with her own brand of contemporary dark ethereal folk-pop. Having already released two singles to critical acclaim, her latest single ""Caught in the Dark"" has already garnered glowing reviews and BBC Radio play, and is the title track of her debut EP, to be released later this year.","Simeon Hammond Dallas","","https://www.greennote.co.uk/production/heard-collective/","https://www.ticketweb.uk/event/heard-collective-featuring-charlotte-campbell-green-note-tickets/9684505","10.0","","","","","","","","Yes","","[""https://www.greennote.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/heardcollective2-1080x608.jpg""]","[""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Np2-Pn4DZY"", ""https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3IOqy55RMY""]","10/18/2019, 03:00:36"
"David Broad","2019-10-19","20:00:00","THE BASEMENT BAR","","David Broad","","DAVID BROAD David's playing is seeped in the tradition of American folk and blues guitar, from the rags of Blind Blake and Reverend Gary Davis, to the delta blues of Robert Johnson and Charley Patton. He is also an accomplished harmonica player in the country blues tradition of Sonny Boy Williamson I and Sonny Terry.
His involvement with the Lindy Hop scene nudged him in the direction of early jazz and swing, but the standards Louis Armstrong may have sung still posses a rural quality. He cut his teeth playing in country and folk bands and will still play the odd bluegrass number if the feeling takes him.
His reworking of traditional songs breathes new life into well worn standards and his original compositions the give a nod to the rootsy side of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Townes Van Zandt.","","","https://www.greennote.co.uk/production/david-broad/","https://www.ticketweb.uk/event/david-broad-green-note-tickets/9764765","10.0","","","","","","","","No","","[""https://www.greennote.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/davidbroad-1.jpg""]","[""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tuIq8SiCKYM"", ""https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0U2l6_8KkA""]","10/18/2019, 03:00:38"
